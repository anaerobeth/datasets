This data set contains 28,348 unique questions that are divided into three subsets: train (20,358), dev (3,994) and eval (3,996), formatted as JSON files: FreebaseQA-[train|dev|eval].json

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

[More Information Needed]

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

The data set is generated by matching trivia-type question-answer pairs with subject-predicateobject triples in Freebase. For each collected question-answer pair, we first tag all entities in each question and search for relevant predicates that bridge a tagged entity with the answer in Freebase. Finally, human annotation is used to remove false positives in these matched triples.
